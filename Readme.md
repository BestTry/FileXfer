# This repository is intended to be a vehicle where I can preserve C++ code and the like originint from my local PC repository.
# Its contents is intended to be saved (pushed) to the Remote Repository (GitHub) for safe keeping.
# In doing this, I hope this results in safe keeping in case unforeseen circumstances arise where I loose local content.
#
# Overriding the major importance as just describe, is that this repository directory will be also used as a transport vehicle 
# between my local home PC computer and some remote PC where I can work on code or files remotely and 
# then return them at another time to my local PC utilizing this "File Transfer" directory.
